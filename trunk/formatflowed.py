        Improperly closed paragraphs
        ----------------------------
        
        The decoder can deal with various cases of improperly format=flowed
        messages. Paragraphs normally end with a fixed line, but the following
        cases are also considered paragraph-closing cases:
        
        - A change in quotedepth:
        
            >>> result = decoder.decode(CRLF.join((
            ... "> Depth one paragraph with flow space. ",
            ... ">> Depth two paragraph with flow space. ",

            ...   ({'quotedepth': 1, 'type': PARAGRAPH},
            ...    u"Depth one paragraph with flow space. "),
            ...   ({'quotedepth': 2, 'type': PARAGRAPH},
            ...    u"Depth two paragraph with flow space. "),
            ...   ({'quotedepth': 0, 'type': FIXED},
            ...    u"Depth zero paragraph with fixed line.")]
            True
        
        - A signature separator:
        
            >>> result = decoder.decode(CRLF.join((
            ... "A paragraph with flow space. ",
            ... "-- ")))
            >>> list(result) == [
            ...   ({'quotedepth': 0, 'type': PARAGRAPH},
            ...    u"A paragraph with flow space. "),
            ...   ({'quotedepth': 0, 'type': SIGNATURE_SEPARATOR}, u"-- ")]
            True
            
        - The end of the message:
        
            >>> result = decoder.decode(CRLF.join((
            ... "A paragraph with flow space. ",)))
            >>> list(result) == [
            ...   ({'quotedepth': 0, 'type': PARAGRAPH},
            ...    u"A paragraph with flow space. ")]
            True
            
            
        Decoder options
        ---------------
            
        The delete_space attribute of the FormatFlowedDecoder class can be used
        to control wether or not the trailing space on flowed lines should be
        retained; this is used to encode flowed text where spaces are rare:
        
            >>> decoder = FormatFlowedDecoder(delete_space=True)
            >>> result = decoder.decode(CRLF.join((
            ... "Contrived example with a word- ",
            ... "break across the paragraph.")))
            >>> list(result) == [
            ...   ({'quotedepth': 0, 'type': PARAGRAPH}, 
            ...    u'Contrived example with a word-break across the '
            ...    u'paragraph.')]
            True
            
        Note that the characterset determines what how to interpret a space
        and a quote marker. The cp037 characterset does not encode these 
        characters the same way, for example:
        
            >>> decoder = FormatFlowedDecoder(character_set='cp037')
            >>> result = decoder.decode(CRLF.join((
            ... "n@\\xe3\\x88\\x89\\xa2@\\x89\\xa2@\\x81@\\x98\\xa4\\x96\\xa3"
            ... "\\x85\\x84@\\x97\\x81\\x99\\x81\\x87\\x99\\x81\\x97\\x88@",
            ... "n@\\x85\\x95\\x83\\x96\\x84\\x85\\x84@\\x89\\x95@\\x83\\x97"
            ... "\\xf0\\xf3\\xf7K")))
            >>> list(result) == [
            ...   ({'quotedepth': 1, 'type': PARAGRAPH},
            ...    u'This is a quoted paragraph encoded in cp037.')]

        quotedepth (default: 0)
          The quote depth of the chunk.
          
          
        Examples
        --------
          
        The encoder has to deal with three types of text chunks. To illustrate,
        we create a encoder instance geared:
        
            >>> encoder = FormatFlowedEncoder(width=45)
            
        We can then use this encoder to encode some examples of these different
        types:
            
        - fixed lines:
        
            >>> encoder.encodeChunk(u'A fixed line remains unaltered', FIXED)
            'A fixed line remains unaltered\\r\\n'
            >>> encoder.encodeChunk(u'Although quoting is prepended', FIXED, 2)
            '>> Although quoting is prepended\\r\\n'
            >>> encoder.encodeChunk(u'Trailing spaces are removed  ', FIXED)
            'Trailing spaces are removed\\r\\n'
            >>> encoder.encodeChunk(u'> and special first chars are fluffed',
            ...                     FIXED)
            ' > and special first chars are fluffed\\r\\n'
            
        - a paragraph (the default type):
        
            >>> result = encoder.encodeChunk(
            ...   u"`Take some more tea,' the March Hare said to Alice, "
            ...   u"very earnestly.")
            >>> result == ("`Take some more tea,' the March Hare said \\r\\n"
            ...            "to Alice, very earnestly.\\r\\n")
            True
            >>> result = encoder.encodeChunk(
            ...   u"`I've had nothing yet,' Alice replied in an offended "
            ...   u"tone, `so I can't take more.'", PARAGRAPH, 1)
            >>> result == ("> `I've had nothing yet,' Alice replied in \\r\\n"
            ...            "> an offended tone, `so I can't take more.'\\r\\n")
            True
            >>> result = encoder.encodeChunk(
            ...   u'The   wrapping   deals   quite   well  with > eratic '
            ...   u'spacing and space fluffs characters where needed.')
            >>> result == ("The   wrapping   deals   quite   well  with \\r\\n"
            ...            " > eratic spacing and space fluffs \\r\\n"
            ...            "characters where needed.\\r\\n")
            True
        
        - signature separators:
        
            >>> encoder.encodeChunk(u'-- ', SIGNATURE_SEPARATOR)
            '-- \\r\\n'
            >>> encoder.encodeChunk(u'-- ', SIGNATURE_SEPARATOR, 3)
            '>>> -- \\r\\n'
            
          Note that the actual chunk value is ignored for this type:
        
            >>> encoder.encodeChunk(u'foobar', SIGNATURE_SEPARATOR)
            '-- \\r\\n'
            
            
        Encoder options
        ---------------
            
        The encoding can be influenced by several instance attributes; the
        width attribute was used for the paragraph demonstrations. Others
        include 'extra_space', 'character_set' and 'spacestuff_quoted':
        
        - extra_space generates extra spaces on flowed lines so flowed lines
          can be broken on something other than whitespace:
          
            >>> encoder = FormatFlowedEncoder(extra_space=True, width=45)
            >>> result = encoder.encodeChunk(
            ...   u'This is useful for texts with many word-breaks or few '
            ...   u'spaces')
            >>> result == ("This is useful for texts with many word- \\r\\n"
            ...            "breaks or few spaces\\r\\n")
            True
            
        - character_set controls the output encoding:
        
            >>> encoder = FormatFlowedEncoder(character_set='cp037')
            >>> result = encoder.encodeChunk(u'Can you read me now?',
            ...                              quotedepth=1)
            >>> result == ('n@\\xc3\\x81\\x95@\\xa8\\x96\\xa4@\\x99\\x85\\x81'
            ...            '\\x84@\\x94\\x85@\\x95\x96\\xa6o\\r\\n')
            True
            
        - spacestuff_quoted causes quoted lines to be spacestuffed by default;
          this makes for slightly more readable quoted text output. It is on
          by default, but can be switched off:
          
            >>> encoder = FormatFlowedEncoder(spacestuff_quoted=False)
            >>> encoder.encodeChunk(u'Look Ma! No space!', quotedepth=1)
            '>Look Ma! No space!\\r\\n'
            
            
        RFC 2822 compliance
        -------------------
        
        Note that RFC 2822 requires that generated lines never exceed the
        hard limit of 998 characters without the CRLF at the end. The encoder 
        has to enforce this by chopping the lines up into pieces not exceeding
        that length:
        
            >>> encoder = FormatFlowedEncoder()
            >>> result = encoder.encodeChunk(u'-' * 1500, FIXED)
            >>> result = result.split('\\r\\n')
            >>> len(result)
            3
            >>> len(result[0])
            998
            >>> result == ['-' * 998, '-' * 502, '']
            True
